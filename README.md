## TODO  

### Extra Credit:  
* Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet.  
Add a . button and let users input decimals!  
Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5.  
(disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)  
* Make it look nice!  
* Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.  
* Add keyboard support!
